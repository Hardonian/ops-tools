# Local production deployment

This reference deployment runs on the EPYC host behind the existing Caddy/Cloudflare ingress.

- Local bind: `127.0.0.1:8082`
- Standalone path: `http://127.0.0.1:8082/` (or sovereign host `https://app.continuityos.com/`)
- Service: `continuityos.service` (systemd user service)
- Route repair: `continuityos-caddy-route.timer` (systemd user timer)
- Backup: `continuityos-backup.timer` (daily, 14-day local retention)
- Data: `/home/scott/.local/share/continuityos`
- Secrets: `/home/scott/.config/continuityos.env` and `/home/scott/.local/share/continuityos/secrets/`
- Outbound HTTP: disabled

The public route is an evaluation/reference surface. It is not a multi-tenant production control plane. Do not place customer or classified data in it.

## Install/update

The idempotent path is:

```bash
bash scripts/install.sh
```

The expanded manual path remains below for operators who need to review each step.

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install --upgrade pip
.venv/bin/pip install .
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
install -m 0644 deploy/continuityos.service ~/.config/systemd/user/continuityos.service
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now continuityos.service
```

Generate keys once with the installed CLI and create the environment file outside Git:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/continuityos/secrets
.venv/bin/continuityos generate-evidence-keys ~/.local/share/continuityos/secrets
umask 077
python3 - <<'PY'
from pathlib import Path
import secrets
p = Path.home()/'.config/continuityos.env'
p.write_text('\n'.join([
    'CONTINUITYOS_ENVIRONMENT=production',
    'CONTINUITYOS_DATA_DIR=/home/scott/.local/share/continuityos',
    'CONTINUITYOS_EVIDENCE_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=/home/scott/.local/share/continuityos/secrets/evidence-private.pem',
    'CONTINUITYOS_EVIDENCE_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH=/home/scott/.local/share/continuityos/secrets/evidence-public.pem',
    f'CONTINUITYOS_API_KEY={secrets.token_urlsafe(32)}',
    f'CONTINUITYOS_OPERATOR_WEBHOOK_SECRET={secrets.token_urlsafe(32)}',
    'CONTINUITYOS_OUTBOUND_HTTP_ENABLED=false',
    'CONTINUITYOS_MAX_SNAPSHOT_AGE_HOURS=72',
    'CONTINUITYOS_COMPILER_MAX_ACTIONS=24',
])+'\n')
p.chmod(0o600)
PY
```

## Verify/rollback

```bash
systemctl --user status continuityos.service --no-pager
systemctl --user status continuityos-caddy-route.timer continuityos-backup.timer --no-pager
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8082/healthz
bash scripts/smoke_live.sh http://127.0.0.1:8082
make doctor
```

`make doctor` is non-destructive. It verifies the managed PID owns the loopback
listener, liveness/readiness/health, anonymous protection, environment-file mode,
backup timer, Terraform/IaC policy, and tracked-secret hygiene. It writes a
sanitized report to `/tmp/continuityos-go-live-doctor.txt` by default.

The broader host currently contains root-owned MicroK8s control-plane wildcard
listeners. ContinuityOS does not modify those automatically. The reviewed,
backup-first host audit/apply runbook is staged at:

```text
/home/scott/.staged/continuityos-host-exposure-hardening.sh
```

It is audit-only unless run by root with `APPLY=1`; review its generated backup
and maintenance window before applying. Never claim host-wide lockdown while
UFW remains inactive or MicroK8s exposure has not been independently verified.

Create a backup before upgrades with `bash scripts/backup_data.sh`. Restore only with an explicit confirmation:

```bash
bash scripts/restore_data.sh --confirm /path/to/continuityos-YYYYmmddTHHMMSSZ.tar.gz
```

Rollback is a service stop/disable plus removal of the Caddy route. Keep the previous Caddyfile backup and use the repo commit history to reinstall an earlier application version. The restore script renames the current data directory before extraction so the rollback remains reversible.
